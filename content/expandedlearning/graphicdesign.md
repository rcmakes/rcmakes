Want to learn how to design graphics? RC Makes will be hosting a workshop to introduce graphic design through gravit.io. Our graphic designer, Angela Batoon, will lead the workshop and walk students through the basics of design as well as logos and typography. At the end of the workshop, students will have designed their own character, logo, and poster.
